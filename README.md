This temperature meter uses an LM35 sensor, set with an arduino UNO board (It can be any arduino, like the Nano for more spacing).

It has a graphical interface that allows you to read the data from the Arduino's SerialPort, and later, it displays it on a graphical meter and a label with the temperature.

THE TEMPERATURE THAT IS IN THE PROGRAM IS IN CELSIUS ..
